# pomodoro-with-extra-features

This is code for running pomodoro with clock and some extra features on ESP-32.

If you want to run this, you will need this firmware [Lua-RTOS-ESP32](https://github.com/whitecatboard/Lua-RTOS-ESP32).

Also, rename `config.lua.default` to `config.lua` and specify your connection settings. This will allow getting correct time from NTP servers.
